# Moses 1 & Book of Abraham - Deep Dive Study

**Date:** January 11, 2026
**Focus:** Identity, Premortal Existence, Divine Purpose

---

## Context

### Historical Setting
- **Moses 1**: Revealed to Joseph Smith in June 1830 as part of the Joseph Smith Translation. Set after the burning bush (Exodus 3-4) but before the Exodus. Moses is "caught up into an exceedingly high mountain" for this theophany.
- **Book of Abraham**: Translated 1835-1842 from Egyptian papyri. Set during Abraham's time in Ur and Egypt, before the covenant events of Genesis 12-17.

### Why These Texts Matter
These texts address fundamental questions:
- Are humans inherently depraved or divine?
- Did we exist before birth?
- Why does anything exist?
- What is Satan's primary attack strategy?

---

## Key Themes

### 1. Divine Identity
**Core Text:** Moses 1:4-6
> "Behold, thou art my son... thou art in the similitude of mine Only Begotten"

God repeatedly affirms Moses's identity *before* Satan attacks. This is the preparation pattern.

### 2. The Identity Attack
**Core Text:** Moses 1:12-22
> Satan: "Moses, son of man, worship me."
> Moses: "Who art thou? For behold, I am a son of God, in the similitude of his Only Begotten"

Satan's strategy: Attack identity first. "Son of man" vs "son of God" — reduce divine nature to mere mortality.

### 3. Cosmic Perspective & Individual Worth
**Core Text:** Moses 1:10, 33, 39
> "Man is nothing, which thing I never had supposed"
> "Worlds without number have I created"
> "This is my work and my glory—to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man"

The paradox: We are cosmically insignificant AND infinitely valuable. God's glory is defined by our success.

### 4. Premortal Existence & Foreordination
**Core Text:** Abraham 3:22-23
> "Among all these there were many of the noble and great ones... Abraham, thou art one of them; thou wast chosen before thou wast born."

We existed. We developed. We were chosen for specific work.

### 5. The Purpose of Mortality
**Core Text:** Abraham 3:24-26
> "We will prove them herewith, to see if they will do all things whatsoever the Lord their God shall command them"

Earth life is a test of obedience and faithfulness. The test only works because of the Atonement.

- **Helaman 14:30** - Agency to act, not be acted upon

### New Testament

## Prophetic Commentary

### Elder M. Russell Ballard (April 2013)
"This Is My Work and Glory" - God's entire purpose is our salvation. The priesthood power that created galaxies exists to bless individual families.

### Elder Neal A. Maxwell (October 1985)
"Premortality, a Glorious Reality" - Those foreordained must still prove "chosen, and faithful." Premortal character matters, but mortal choices determine destiny.

### President Thomas S. Monson
"The worth of a human soul is its capacity to become as God."

### Elder Rubén V. Alliaud (October 2024)
"Sons and Daughters of God" - Satan's attack on Moses—calling him "son of man"—is the same attack he uses on us. Understanding our true identity "fundamentally changes personal decisions and spiritual direction."

### Elder Brik V. Eyre (October 2025)
"Know Who You Really Are" - "When you know and understand how completely you are loved as a child of God, it changes everything."

## Gospel Principles

### Doctrines Taught
1. **Divine Identity** - We are literal spirit children of God
2. **Premortal Existence** - We lived and developed before birth
3. **Purpose of Earth Life** - Testing, bodies, proving faithfulness
4. **Nature of God** - Glorified being who knows us personally
5. **Agency** - Central to the plan; we must choose
6. **Satan's Tactics** - Attack identity first

### How This Points to Christ
- Moses is "in the similitude of mine Only Begotten" — Christ is the prototype
- Christ was the "Chosen" one at the premortal council (Moses 4:2)
- The test only works because of the Atonement
- Moses resists Satan by invoking the Only Begotten's name (Moses 1:21)

## Parallels

### Lord of the Rings
- Frodo: "I am not made for perilous quests" — yet he was chosen
- The hobbits' worth isn't in their power but their faithfulness
- Providence working through the small and simple

### Programming
- Foreordination as compile-time assignment; mortal choices as runtime execution
- Identity as immutable core state that shouldn't be overwritten
- Satan's attack as attempting to corrupt the identity object

### Anime
- Naruto's identity declarations against self-doubt ("I will be Hokage")
- Zuko's struggle with identity (son of the Fire Lord vs. his own path)
- The hero who discovers they were chosen for a purpose all along

## Personal Application

### Questions to Ponder
1. When does Satan try to convince you that you're "just" mortal, flawed, insignificant?
2. How do you hold both truths—cosmic insignificance AND infinite worth?
3. What gifts or callings feel like they were prepared specifically for you?
4. What commandment or prompting are you currently being tested on?
5. What does it mean that God wins when you win?

### Call to Action
Moses resisted Satan because God had *repeatedly* told him who he was before the attack came. **Saturate yourself in identity declarations before the adversary attacks.** Read your patriarchal blessing. Rehearse scriptures about divine sonship/daughtership.

## Journal Prompts

1. **Letter from your premortal self**: Based on Abraham 3, you were there. You saw the plan. You chose this. What would that version of you want you to remember?

2. **Map your Moses 1 experience**: When have you felt God's presence, only to have Satan attack afterward? How did you resist?

3. **"This is my work and my glory"**: If God's purpose and glory is your exaltation, how does that change how you view your mistakes? Your potential?

## Key Verses to Memorize

- **Moses 1:39** - "This is my work and my glory—to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man"
- **Abraham 3:22-23** - "These I will make my rulers... thou wast chosen before thou wast born"
