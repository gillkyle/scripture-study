# The Mage Who Learned to Mourn: Frieren and the Plan of Salvation

*An exploration of eternal perspective, mortal proving grounds, and the purpose of connection*

---

## Introduction: An Elf at a Funeral

The anime *Frieren: Beyond Journey's End* opens with an ending. The Hero Himmel, who saved the world alongside the elven mage Frieren, dies of old age. At his funeral, Frieren weeps — and then says something that haunts the entire series:

> "I feel like... I should have tried to get to know him better."

She had spent ten years adventuring with Himmel. Ten years of battles, travels, and shared meals. But to an elf who has lived over a thousand years, a decade felt like "just a bit." Only at the funeral does she realize that "just a bit" contained something irreplaceable — and she had failed to fully receive it.

This is where *Frieren* begins. But it's also, in a profound way, where the plan of salvation begins: with an eternal being choosing to enter a limited frame of existence, not despite its brevity, but *because* of what that limitation makes possible.

## Part I: "Man Is Nothing" — The Weight of Eternal Perspective

When Moses beheld God's creations, the experience shattered his previous understanding:

> "And the presence of God withdrew from Moses, that his glory was not upon Moses; and Moses was left unto himself. And as he was left unto himself, he fell unto the earth. And it came to pass that it was for the space of many hours before Moses did again receive his natural strength like unto man; and he said unto himself: **Now, for this cause I know that man is nothing, which thing I never had supposed.**" (Moses 1:9-10)

Moses glimpsed eternity, and it crushed him. For hours he could not stand. The infinite scope of God's works made his own existence feel vanishingly small.

Frieren knows this feeling intimately — not from a single vision, but from a thousand years of lived experience. She has watched civilizations rise and fall. She has seen human friends age from childhood to death in what feels to her like a blink. When she looks at a human lifespan, she sees what Moses saw when he looked at God's creations: something so brief as to approach meaninglessness.

And yet.

Moses's revelation doesn't end with "man is nothing." It ends with *this*:

> "For behold, this is my work and my glory — **to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man.**" (Moses 1:39)

The same God who created worlds without number centers His entire purpose on *us*. The infinite serves the personal. The eternal cares about the mortal.

Frieren's entire character arc is learning this same truth from the other direction. She begins the series treating human relationships as pleasant but ultimately inconsequential — background noise in an immortal existence. Her journey is discovering that those "insignificant" mortal connections were, in fact, the only thing that ever mattered.

The spell she treasures most isn't one of devastating power. It's *Zoltraak*, the demon-slaying magic — but not for its destructive capability. She treasures it because Himmel once complimented her on it. And she spends decades perfecting a spell to create a field of flowers, simply because Himmel said he wanted to see them bloom with her.

An immortal being, finding her purpose in a mortal's smile.

Is this not the plan of salvation in miniature? An eternal God, whose works are endless, finding His glory in *our* immortality and eternal life?

## Part II: "We Will Prove Them Herewith" — The Mortal Proving Ground

Abraham was shown the intelligences that existed before the world:

> "Now the Lord had shown unto me, Abraham, the intelligences that were organized before the world was; and among all these there were many of the noble and great ones." (Abraham 3:22)

These intelligences — including us — existed before mortality. We had identities, capacities, even varying degrees of nobility. But something was missing. Something that required a proving ground:

> "And we will prove them herewith, to see if they will do all things whatsoever the Lord their God shall command them." (Abraham 3:25)

The pre-mortal existence wasn't enough. We needed to be *proven*. We needed an earth "whereon these may dwell" — a limited, bounded experience where our choices would reveal and refine our character.

Frieren's journey to Ende (the place where souls are said to dwell) functions as exactly this kind of proving ground. She isn't traveling to gain power; she's already one of the most powerful mages alive. She isn't seeking knowledge; she has a millennium of accumulated wisdom. She travels because she needs to discover something that power and knowledge cannot provide: the capacity to *value*.

Throughout the series, Frieren faces tests — not primarily of magical ability, but of character. Will she take on an apprentice (Fern) even though humans die so quickly? Will she invest in relationships she knows will end in loss? Will she let herself *feel* the weight of mortality rather than numbing herself to it?

These are the questions of mortality itself. Will we love, knowing we will lose? Will we connect, knowing connection brings vulnerability? Will we invest in things that seem, from an eternal perspective, heartbreakingly brief?

The plan of salvation says: *yes*. That is precisely the point.

> "And they who keep their first estate shall be added upon; and they who keep not their first estate shall not have glory in the same kingdom with those who keep their first estate; and **they who keep their second estate shall have glory added upon their heads for ever and ever.**" (Abraham 3:26)

The "adding upon" doesn't come from avoiding mortality's limitations — it comes from *passing through* them. Frieren's growth doesn't happen despite Himmel's death; it happens *because* of it. The loss cracks her open. The limitation becomes the teacher.

## Part III: Intelligences and Choice — What the Proving Reveals

Abraham learned that intelligences vary:

> "If there be two spirits, and one shall be more intelligent than the other, yet these two spirits, notwithstanding one is more intelligent than the other, have no beginning; they existed before, they shall have no end, they shall exist after, for they are gnolaum, or eternal." (Abraham 3:18)

We are not blank slates. We come into mortality with inherent nature — what Abraham calls *intelligence*. Mortality doesn't create our character from nothing; it reveals and refines what was already there.

The priest Sein, who travels with Frieren's party for a time, embodies this beautifully. He grapples constantly with what he should do with his life. Should he continue the grand adventure? Should he pursue his priestly duties? In the end, he chooses to leave the party and search for his childhood friend who went missing years ago. His choice reveals his intelligence — he is someone who prioritizes personal bonds over grand narratives.

Frieren herself reveals her intelligence through her choices. For centuries, she chose isolation and magical study. She wasn't incapable of connection; she simply didn't value it. Her nature was to observe rather than engage, to collect spells rather than relationships.

But nature is not destiny. That's the point of the proving ground.

Slowly — so slowly that only an immortal would have the patience for it — Frieren begins choosing differently. She takes on Fern as an apprentice. She travels with companions instead of alone. She starts collecting experiences with people instead of just magical techniques.

Each choice reveals. Each choice refines. By the time Frieren approaches Ende, she is not the same intelligence who attended Himmel's funeral. The nature is still there — she's still quiet, still awkward, still more comfortable with spells than small talk. But her *choices* have shaped that nature into something new. Something more.

This is what the plan of salvation offers: not the erasure of our intelligence, but its elevation. We keep who we are. But through choosing, we become more of it — or less.

## Part IV: Memory, Legacy, and Eternal Life

One of *Frieren's* most poignant recurring elements is the mage's hobby of collecting spells — particularly useless ones. A spell that makes flowers bloom. A spell that makes sweet grapes sour. A spell that creates a small bird.

These spells have no combat application. They are, by conventional measures, worthless.

But Frieren treasures them. Why?

Because they are *connections*. Each spell was created by a mage who lived and died and left this small piece of themselves behind. When Frieren casts these spells, she is communing with the dead. She is saying: *you existed. You mattered. I remember.*

This is, in its own way, a doctrine of eternal life.

Moses 1:35 teaches that God's creations are "innumerable... unto man; but **all things are numbered unto me, for they are mine and I know them.**"

Nothing is lost to God. Every world that "passes away" is still numbered, still known, still *His*. The infinite does not erase the particular. The eternal does not swallow the momentary.

Frieren's journey is learning to know things the way God knows them — not despite their brevity, but *through* it. Himmel's life was short. But it is numbered unto Frieren. She knows him. And in that knowing, something of him continues.

Is this not what we hope for in eternal life? Not the erasure of mortality, but its *redemption*. Everything we loved, everyone we knew, all of it gathered up, numbered, known. Nothing truly lost.

Frieren cannot literally resurrect Himmel. But she can journey to Ende, the place of souls, hoping to speak with him one more time. And even if she never reaches him, the journey itself has transformed her into someone who *would* make such a journey.

That transformation — that becoming — is the eternal life she carries within herself.

## Part V: The Hero's Party and the Divine Council

Before the world was created, there was a council:

> "And there stood one among them that was like unto God, and he said unto those who were with him: We will go down, for there is space there, and we will take of these materials, and we will make an earth whereon these may dwell." (Abraham 3:24)

There was a *party*. A fellowship. The work of salvation was not a solo endeavor but a collective undertaking, with different intelligences contributing according to their gifts.

*Frieren* is built on the same structure. The Hero's Party — Himmel the hero, Heiter the priest, Eisen the warrior, and Frieren the mage — each brought something essential to the quest. None of them could have defeated the Demon King alone. It required the fellowship.

And the party continues, even after the original members pass. Fern becomes Frieren's apprentice. Stark becomes her warrior companion. Sein joins for a time as the priest. The roles persist even as the individuals change.

Is this not the Church? The priesthood? The gathering of Israel?

The plan of salvation is not merely individual. It is, as Abraham learned, a council endeavor. "We will go down." "We will prove them." The first-person plural is intentional.

Frieren learns — slowly, reluctantly — that she cannot walk to Ende alone. She needs companions. Not because she lacks power, but because the journey itself requires what only fellowship can provide: witnesses to your growth, companions in your grief, friends who remind you what you're journeying toward.

> "And the Lord said: Whom shall I send? And one answered like unto the Son of Man: Here am I, send me." (Abraham 3:27)

Someone has to volunteer. Someone has to step forward. Himmel did this when he asked Frieren to join the party. Christ did this before the foundation of the world. And we do this, each time we answer a call to serve alongside others in a work larger than ourselves.

## Conclusion: The Journey to Ende and the Promise of Return

At its heart, *Frieren: Beyond Journey's End* is a story about learning to love mortal things with an immortal heart.

The plan of salvation asks something similar of us. We are eternal intelligences, placed in mortal frames, asked to invest in relationships that will (from one perspective) inevitably end. We are asked to love children who will grow up, parents who will age, friends who will move away or pass on.

Why?

Because the investment is the point. The limitation is the teacher. The brevity is what makes the connection *mean* something.

Frieren attends Himmel's funeral having failed to fully know him. But the series doesn't end at that funeral. It ends with a journey — an ongoing attempt to understand, to remember, to carry forward what was given.

She will reach Ende. She will (we hope) speak with Himmel again. And when she does, she will not be the mage who failed to know him. She will be the mage who spent decades *learning* to know him through his absence.

Is this not the promise embedded in Moses's revelation?

> "For behold, this is my work and my glory — to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man." (Moses 1:39)

Not just that we will *exist* forever — but that we will be *alive* forever. That the relationships forged in mortality will not be erased but eternal. That the God who numbers worlds without number also numbers every soul, every connection, every moment of genuine love.

Frieren journeys to Ende hoping to see Himmel once more.

We journey through mortality with the same hope — that the veil is not a wall, that the parting is not permanent, that every "this is my work and my glory" spoken by God over His children will culminate in reunion.

The mage who learned to mourn is still learning. So are we.

But we are not walking alone.

## Questions for Reflection

1. What relationships in your life have you treated as Frieren treated her decade with Himmel — valuable, but not urgent? What would it mean to see them with eternal weight?

2. How have the *limitations* of mortality taught you things that endless time never could?

3. Who is in your "party"? Who has God placed alongside you for this portion of the journey?

4. Frieren collects spells as a way of remembering mages who have died. What do you collect? What do those collections reveal about what you value?

5. If you could speak one more time with someone who has passed on, what would you want them to know about who you've become since they left?
