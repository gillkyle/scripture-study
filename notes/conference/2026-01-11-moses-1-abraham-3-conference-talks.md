## SUMMARY OF KEY THEMES

### 1. Divine Identity (Moses 1)
- God teaches Moses (and us) that we are His children
- Satan attacks our understanding of identity, calling us "son/daughter of man" (merely mortal)
- Resisting Satan requires asserting our divine identity: "I am a son/daughter of God"
- This is the foundation of all other truth

### 2. God's Purpose (Moses 1:39)
- God's work and glory is bringing to pass our immortality and eternal life
- This is His primary focus—our success and exaltation
- All priesthood power exists to bless and prepare families for eternal life

### 3. Premortal Existence (Abraham 3)
- We existed as spirits before birth
- Many were "noble and great ones" chosen for specific missions
- Abraham (and others) were "chosen before [they were] born"
- Foreordination applies to all Church members, not just prophets

### 4. Foreordination
- We were prepared and chosen in premortal councils
- This doesn't guarantee specific callings or outcomes
- We must still prove "chosen, and faithful" through agency
- We discover our foreordained missions through prayer and scripture study

### 5. Worth of Souls
- "The worth of souls is great in the sight of God" (D&C 18:10)
- Our worth = "our capacity to become as God"
- We are "immortal beings of infinite potential and worth"
- We are "blessed beings of light, spirit children of an infinite God"

## CONNECTING THEMES

### Identity → Purpose → Worth
1. **Identity**: We are children of God (Moses 1)
2. **Purpose**: God's work is to bring about our exaltation (Moses 1:39)
3. **Premortal**: We were chosen before birth for specific missions (Abraham 3)
4. **Worth**: Our value comes from our divine potential to become like God

### The Pattern of Satan's Attack
**Against Moses:** "Son of man" (deny divinity) → "Worship me"
**Against Jesus:** "If thou be the Son of God" (create doubt) → Temptations
**Against Us:** Question our divine identity → Lead us away from God

### The Pattern of Resistance
**Moses:** Called upon God → Asserted identity → Commanded Satan to depart
**Jesus:** Quoted scripture → Affirmed His mission → Resisted temptation
**Us:** Remember who we are → Call upon God → Assert our divine identity

## STUDY QUESTIONS

1. How does knowing I was chosen before birth affect my understanding of life's challenges?

2. When do I most feel like "son/daughter of man" rather than "son/daughter of God"? What triggers this?

3. How does understanding that God's work and glory is MY immortality and eternal life change how I view His commandments?

4. What might be my foreordained mission? What gifts and talents point toward it?

5. How can I better "see through the lens of pure love" to recognize the infinite worth in myself and others?

6. What does it mean that "the worth of a soul is its capacity to become as God"?
