# They Seeing See Not: Three Kinds of Sight and the Way Jesus Taught

## The Paradox at the Heart of the Parables

When the disciples asked Jesus why he taught in parables, they expected a pedagogical explanation. What they received was something far more unsettling:

> "Because it is given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it is not given... Therefore speak I to them in parables: because they seeing see not; and hearing they hear not, neither do they understand." (Matthew 13:11, 13)

This is not blindness. Blindness would be innocent—a limitation, not a condition. What Jesus describes is something stranger and more tragic: sight that fails to become seeing. The equipment works. The image reaches the eye. Light enters the pupil, strikes the retina, travels the optic nerve to the brain. And nothing happens.

Jesus taught the way he did because he understood something essential about human perception: we can look directly at truth and miss it entirely. The parable is not a failure of clarity but a response to a failure of sight—and an invitation to see differently.

## The Three Kinds of Sight

Scripture reveals three distinct ways of not seeing, and only one of them can be healed.

### 1. The Blindness That Knows Itself

In John 9, Jesus heals a man born blind. The man has never seen anything—not light, not color, not the faces of his parents. He knows exactly what he lacks.

When Jesus restores his sight, the man's response is uncomplicated by pretense:

> "One thing I know, that, whereas I was blind, now I see." (John 9:25)

He cannot explain the theology. When the Pharisees press him on whether Jesus is a sinner, he offers no sophisticated defense: "Whether he be a sinner or no, I know not" (John 9:25). He knows only his experience—darkness, then light.

This blindness is safe. It can be healed precisely because it makes no claim to sight. The man born blind had no illusions to protect, no interpretive framework to defend, no expertise to preserve. He was empty in exactly the way that could be filled.

His poverty of sight became the condition of receiving it.

### 2. The Sight That Claims Itself

The Pharisees watched the same miracle. They had working eyes. They saw the man, saw the mud, saw the transformation. And they concluded that Jesus was a sinner who violated the Sabbath.

Jesus delivers the most devastating diagnosis in the Gospels:

> "For judgment I am come into this world, that they which see not might see; and that they which see might be made blind." (John 9:39)

The Pharisees, catching the implication, ask: "Are we blind also?" (John 9:40).

Jesus's answer should stop every reader who has ever been confident in their understanding:

> "If ye were blind, ye should have no sin: but now ye say, We see; therefore your sin remaineth." (John 9:41)

The claim to sight becomes the blindness. The Pharisees see without seeing *because they are certain they see*. They have studied Torah their entire lives. They can parse Hebrew, debate interpretation, cite precedent. Their vision is comprehensive. Their framework is complete.

And that completeness is the cataract nothing can remove.

The most dangerous form of not-seeing is the sight that has concluded its work. The Pharisees weren't ignorant—they were expert. They didn't lack information—they had too much certainty about what the information meant. Every new datum, including a miraculous healing, was processed through a framework that could not be wrong.

When you know you see, you cannot receive sight. The prescription requires a diagnosis you will not accept.

### 3. The Sight That Refuses Itself

The prophet Samuel the Lamanite names a third category with uncomfortable directness:

> "O ye wicked and ye perverse generation; ye hardened and ye stiffnecked people, how long will ye suppose that the Lord will suffer you? Yea, how long will ye suffer yourselves to be led by foolish and blind guides? Yea, how long will ye **choose** darkness rather than light?" (Helaman 13:29)

Not "how long will you be unable to see?" but "how long will you choose not to?"

This is the sight that knows what it sees and turns away. The light is present. The eyes function. The image forms. And the will refuses.

Nephi speaks of those who "have eyes to see, and see not; they have ears to hear, and hear not: for they are a rebellious house" (quoting Ezekiel 12:2). The diagnosis is not incapacity but rebellion. They could see if they would. They won't.

This refusal is not always dramatic. Often it is quiet—a turning of attention, a changing of subject, a reframing that makes the uncomfortable truth someone else's concern. The rich young ruler saw Jesus clearly, heard the invitation plainly, and "went away sorrowful" (Matthew 19:22). His eyes worked perfectly. His will chose otherwise.

## Why Jesus Spoke in Parables

Understanding these three kinds of sight illuminates why Jesus taught the way he did.

A God who wanted mere compliance would speak with overwhelming clarity. He would remove ambiguity, compel acknowledgment, and make rejection irrational. But that produces slaves, not sons. It produces the obedience of those who have no choice, not the transformation of those who choose.

Jesus wanted friends:

> "Henceforth I call you not servants; for the servant knoweth not what his lord doeth: but I have called you friends; for all things that I have heard of my Father I have made known unto you." (John 15:15)

Friends choose the relationship. They pursue understanding. They stay when they could leave.

The parable creates space for this choosing. Consider the sower story: a farmer scatters seed, and it falls on different soils with different results. A child could understand the literal content. The crowds heard it, nodded at the agricultural realism, and went home.

The disciples stayed. They came back. They asked, "What does this mean?"

The difference was not intelligence. The disciples were not sophisticated theologians—they were fishermen and tax collectors. The difference was *staying to ask*. The parable revealed who would pursue and who was satisfied with surfaces.

> "And the disciples came, and said unto him, Why speakest thou unto them in parables?" (Matthew 13:10)

The very act of asking this question demonstrated why they would receive the answer. They were the kind of people who wanted to know. And wanting to know—genuinely, persistently—is the soil in which understanding grows.

The parable does not hide truth from those who seek it. It reveals the seeker.

## The Bronze Serpent and the Problem of Simpleness

The most haunting illustration of sight that refuses itself appears not in the Gospels but in the wilderness of Numbers, and its interpretation in the Book of Mormon.

When fiery serpents plagued Israel, God commanded Moses to make a bronze serpent and lift it on a pole. The cure was absurdly simple: look at the serpent and live. No ritual. No sacrifice. No journey. Just look.

And many refused.

Nephi explains the tragedy:

> "He sent fiery flying serpents among them; and after they were bitten he prepared a way that they might be healed; and the labor which they had to perform was to look; and **because of the simpleness of the way, or the easiness of it, there were many who perished.**" (1 Nephi 17:41)

They perished not because the cure was hidden but because it was too obvious. Looking at a bronze snake couldn't possibly be the answer. Surely healing required something more sophisticated, more effortful, more worthy of their intelligence. The simpleness of the way offended them.

Alma confirms that this was not merely a wilderness oddity but a type of Christ himself:

> "Behold, he was spoken of by Moses; yea, and behold a type was raised up in the wilderness, that whosoever would look upon it might live. And many did look and live." (Alma 33:19)

Many did look and live. The unstated horror is that some looked and died—or rather, some saw the serpent and refused to look in the way that would heal. The bronze serpent was visible to everyone. The promise was announced to everyone. And some, seeing, saw not.

The gospel presents the same offense of simplicity. Love your enemies—surely that's too naive. Forgive seventy times seven—that can't be practical. Lose your life to find it—paradoxical nonsense that must mean something more sophisticated.

We see these teachings. We understand the words. And we construct theologies, frameworks, nuances, and qualifications—anything to avoid the embarrassment of acting on something a child could grasp.

## The Mercy Hidden in Obscurity

There is another way to read Matthew 13—not as judgment but as protection.

Full, clear truth presented to an unprepared heart does not convert. It hardens. The Pharisees did not lack plain teaching. They had Moses. They had the prophets. They had crystal clarity about the law. And that clarity made them *worse*, because they could reject it with full knowledge, check boxes without transformation, master technicalities while missing the point entirely.

Jesus quotes Isaiah's commission, where God commands the prophet:

> "Make the heart of this people fat, and make their ears heavy, and shut their eyes; lest they see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and convert, and be healed." (Isaiah 6:10)

That "lest they be healed" may not be malice. It may be mercy.

Perhaps the healing Jesus speaks of is not ultimate salvation but a *premature* healing—the kind that relieves symptoms without curing disease. The crowds wanted miracles. They wanted bread, spectacle, a political messiah who would overthrow Rome. If Jesus spoke with total clarity and they "converted," what would they be converting to? A shallow discipleship that wanted his power without his character, his benefits without his cross.

The parable offers truth in a form that can be ignored without full culpability. Those who walk away from a farming story are not damned for rejecting Christ—they don't even know they encountered anything ultimate. The parable protects the unready from the full weight of refusing plainly.

But for those who stay and ask—for those who see enough to suspect there's more—the private teaching follows. The mysteries unfold. The friendship deepens.

## The Invitation That Remains

The parable is not a locked door. It is a door that opens to knocking.

> "Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you." (Matthew 7:7)

The disciples received understanding not as reward for superior intelligence but because they were the kind of people who would ask for it. They pursued. They stayed. They knocked.

The one who stays to ask the meaning is already showing they want the relationship, not just the information—the friendship, not just the rules. That posture is the soil in which transformation becomes possible.

Jesus did not want subservience. A God who wanted subservience would compel, overwhelm, and remove all possibility of misunderstanding. Jesus wanted something far more costly and far more glorious: he wanted friends who would become like him.

> "For whosoever hath, to him shall be given, and he shall have more abundance." (Matthew 13:12)

This is not cosmic unfairness. It is the nature of seeking. Those who want understanding receive more understanding because they keep seeking. Those who are satisfied with surfaces stop looking. The gap widens not because God plays favorites but because seeking compounds while satisfaction stagnates.

## The Mirror

The most dangerous response to "they seeing see not" is to assure yourself you are among those who truly see. That is precisely what the Pharisees did. They had no doubt about their sight. Their certainty was absolute.

The honest response is to suspect you might be seeing without seeing right now—today, in this passage, in your prayers, in your relationships, in your discipleship. And then to stay. And ask.

What truth has been plainly taught to you that you refuse to hear? What simple thing are you rejecting because it is too simple? What healing are you avoiding because you don't want to become what the healing would make you?

The parable still speaks. The serpent still hangs in the wilderness. The seed still falls.

The only question is whether you will look. Whether you will stay to ask. Whether you will let simpleness save you.

> "Who hath ears to hear, let him hear." (Matthew 13:9)
