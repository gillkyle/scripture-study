# Tithing: Gross vs. Net

## The Question
Should I pay tithing on gross income or net income?

## My Practice
I pay on gross, and it feels right to me.

## The Tension I Wrestled With
I noticed I *wanted* to feel cheated by friends who pay on net—a desire for my sacrifice to count more, frustration that others might get the same blessings with less cost, and a sense of fairness ("we should all play by the same rules"). Plus the practical reality: that net difference is real money I could use.

## Key Insight: Sacrifice Is the Point

D&C 97:12 calls tithing "the tithing and the **sacrifice** which I, the Lord, require."

The Hebrew word for offering—*korban*—comes from the root meaning "to draw near." The sacrifice is the mechanism of drawing closer to God.

**The spiritual value isn't in the amount. It's in the cost.**

- If paying on gross were easy and painless for me, it would lose its meaning
- The felt weight of that difference is part of what makes it spiritually formative
- The challenge *is* the reward

## Reframe on Comparison

If the value is in the sacrifice—the actual felt cost—then:

1. My gross payment is right *for me* because it costs me something real
2. That cost is the very thing that makes it spiritually formative
3. Others' "smaller" payments might cost *them* just as much
4. God is measuring sacrifice, not percentages

**The widow's mite** wasn't much in absolute terms. But Jesus said she "cast in more than they all" because of what it cost *her* (Mark 12:41-44).

## What the Church Actually Teaches

The First Presidency (March 19, 1970):
> "Every member of the Church should be entitled to make his own decision as to what he thinks he owes the Lord, and to make payment accordingly."

Elder Dallin H. Oaks: "I admire those who pay on the gross. I don't condemn those who pay on the net."

God left this to individual agency intentionally. The personal nature of the sacrifice is the point.

## Resolution

Comparison dissolves when I realize:
- My practice is right for me because of what it costs me
- My friends' practice can be right for them because of what it costs them
- We're all drawing near through sacrifice—just calibrated differently
