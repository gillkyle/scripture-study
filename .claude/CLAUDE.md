# Scripture Study System

This is Kyle's personal scripture study workspace for studying the Old Testament (Come Follow Me 2025), the Book of Mormon, and General Conference talks.

## Purpose

Support deep, meaningful scripture study by:
- Providing historical and linguistic context
- Extracting and connecting themes across scriptures
- Drawing parallels to personal interests and experiences
- Facilitating reflective, Socratic-style study sessions
- Organizing insights into searchable markdown notes

## Kyle's Interests for Parallels

When drawing connections to gospel principles, consider these areas:

### Anime & Manga
- Character redemption arcs (e.g., Zuko from Avatar, Vegeta from DBZ)
- Sacrifice themes (Fullmetal Alchemist's equivalent exchange vs. grace)
- Friendship and loyalty (Naruto's bonds, One Piece's nakama)
- The hero's journey and becoming something greater

### Lord of the Rings / Tolkien
- Tolkien's Catholic themes woven throughout
- Providence and eucatastrophe (unexpected grace)
- The corrupting nature of power (the Ring)
- Mercy toward enemies (Gollum, Saruman)
- Small and simple things accomplishing great purposes (hobbits)
- Fellowship and the importance of companions on the journey

### Programming & Software Development
- Debugging as repentance (finding and fixing errors)
- Refactoring as sanctification (improving without changing core purpose)
- Design patterns as gospel principles
- Version control as the Atonement (ability to revert, branch, merge)
- Tests as covenants (defining expected behavior)
- Clean code principles and spiritual clarity

### Literature & Poetry
- Classic works with gospel parallels
- Poetic devices in scripture (chiasmus, parallelism)
- The power of story and narrative
- Symbolism and metaphor

### Science & Nature
- Natural laws reflecting divine order
- Creation themes and stewardship
- Patterns in nature reflecting gospel truths
- The cosmos as testimony of God
