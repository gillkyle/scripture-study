# Theme Extraction

Analyze the following for themes: **$ARGUMENTS**

## Analysis Process

### 1. Read the Text
If a scripture reference is provided, retrieve and quote the relevant text.
If text is pasted directly, work with that content.

### 2. Identify Major Themes
List 3-5 primary themes present in the text:
- Name each theme clearly
- Provide the verses/lines that support each theme
- Explain how the theme manifests in the text

### 3. Identify Minor/Supporting Themes
List 2-3 secondary themes:
- These may be subtle or only briefly mentioned
- Note how they support or connect to major themes

### 4. Theme Connections

#### Within the Passage
- How do the themes relate to each other?
- Is there progression or tension between themes?

#### Across Scripture
For each major theme, provide:
- 2-3 Old Testament cross-references
- 2-3 Book of Mormon cross-references
- 1-2 New Testament connections (if applicable)

#### To Gospel Principles
Connect themes to:
- Core doctrines (Atonement, Plan of Salvation, etc.)
- Christlike attributes
- Covenant living

### 5. Thematic Questions
Generate questions that help explore each theme more deeply:
- What does this theme teach about God?
- What does this theme teach about humanity?
- How does this theme apply to discipleship?
